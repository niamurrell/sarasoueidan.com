                            In this article, you'll learn everything you need to know to get started using CSS Shapes today. We will cover all the prerequisites: establishing a coordinate system, conditions for elements to be eligible for shapes, and more, then moving on to the properties used, their values and how each one affects the shape created, with lots of visual explanations and examples.

                            I wrote this article before the news came out that Google decided to pull Regions out of Blink, which, in my opinion, is a big loss for the web community. So, even though the content of the article may go in vain, I think it&rsquo;s still worth sharing why I think CSS Regions mattered, and wish they weren&rsquo;t ditched like that. I hope you guys like it anyway.

                            Today we're going to be talking about animating CSS shapes with CSS animations. We'll be creating very basic "shape-shifting" layouts of sort. There are also many considerations to take when animating CSS shapes, so we'll go over all points in this article. This is the third article in a series of articles I&rsquo;m writing about CSS shapes, so in this article I&rsquo;m assuming you have a basic understanding of how CSS shapes are created.

                            Using CSS shapes we can flow our content in non-rectangular areas. And sometimes we want to be able to flow our content into multiple custom-shaped areas inside an element. If you've read my previous article, you already know that this can be done with CSS Shapes, by using an image with alpha transparency with multiple shapes defined in it, and letting the browser extract the content's float areas from it. As appealing as this may sound and as creative as we can get with our shapes, flowing the text into multiple areas can easily make our content almost completely unreadable.

                            For too long, we've resorted to graphics editors to create images of text that has nice effects such as creative fills or that blends with its background in a nice subtle way. We used those images as a replacement for text on our pages, which made that text unaccessible and un-selectable.. But with all the advances in web design today, we can now create textured text effects using CSS, using SVG, and using HTML5 Canvas.

                            Overlays can sometimes be annoying, but also undoubtedly have their useful use cases. There are different approaches to creating overlays, some of them work better than others, and some of them come with gotchas that you need to be aware of, including performance implications. In HTML5, we also get a native way to create modals with less hassle and less code. In this article, we will cover all of that.

                            Today we can create all kinds of shapes with CSS using CSS transforms, but all these shapes do not affect the flow of the content inside or around them. That is, if you create a triangle or a trapezoid with CSS, for example, the shape created does not define or affect the way the text inside it flows, or the way inline text around it does.
With the introduction of CSS Shapes into the web, wrapping content in custom non-rectangular shapes, and recreating print designs and layouts on the web becomes a piece of cake!

                            The following is a collaboration post between Bennett Feely and I. After seeing Bennett's impressive animated navigation icon transformations (or "Navicon Transformicons") pens on Codepen, I asked him if he would like to write a tutorial on how he did them as a guest post on my blog. He kindly approved. And as he doesn't have a lot of free time to work the article, we decided to collaborate on it.
