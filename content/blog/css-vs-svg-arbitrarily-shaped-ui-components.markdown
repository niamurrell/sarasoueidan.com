	This post is the third in the series of posts exploring techniques and examples that can be achieved using both CSS and SVG, and compares them both.In this article, we are going to go over techniques for creating arbitrarily-shaped UI components using CSS properties and SVG’s capabilities, and a mix of both! Specifically, we will be talking about how to create circular menus, as these are the perfect example of usable non-rectangular UI elements.
