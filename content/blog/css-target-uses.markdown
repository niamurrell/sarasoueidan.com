	 You may or may not have used the :target selector before; and you may or may not have used it to show and hide elements without having to resort to JavaScript to handle this event for you. This article I wrote for the Adobe Dreamweaver team blog, serves as a short introduction to the :target selector, showing how you can use it to create JavaScript-less UI effects—for example, overlays, modals, etc.
