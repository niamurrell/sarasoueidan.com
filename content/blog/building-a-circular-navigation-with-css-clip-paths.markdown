<p class="size-2x">
	The CSS <code>clip-path</code> property is one of the most underused and yet most interesting properties in CSS. It can be used in conjunction with CSS Shapes to create interesting layouts, and can be taken to the extreme to create some incredibly impressive layouts and animations like the Species in Pieces project. While exploring the creation of arbitrarily-shaped UI components using CSS and SVG, it occurred to me that the clip-path property, when combined with SVG paths, can be used to create circular menus fairly easily, especially considering the (expected) browser behaviour when handling pointer events on clipped regions as per the specification. In this article, we'll explore this idea further and learn how it's done.
