      <description>Happy new year! 🌟
OK, I felt awkward starting a blog post that way—I confess. ☺️ But this is also an unusual post—not an article about CSS or SVG, and not a lengthy tutorial about web development. It is also the quickest post I ever wrote.
This is my first time writing a year in review kind of post. A lot of great stuff has happened in 2015 that I thought are worth documenting and have a look back at a few years from now.</description>
