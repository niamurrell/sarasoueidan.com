title: The State of SVG Animation
subtitle: ""
---

<p class="size-2x">
	The state of SVG animation is changing. CSS, SMIL and JavaScript can be used to animate SVGs. However, SMIL is soon to be deprecated and was never supported in Internet Explorer. CSS animations on SVG elements donâ€™t have the best browser support (yet), not to mention are quite buggy in some browsers. JavaScript is currently the best SVG animation tool. In this article, we'll go over the current and future state of SVG animation, giving you an overview of what you can and can't do, and some advice on what to choose for your specific animation needs.
