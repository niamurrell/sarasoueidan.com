<!-- You can get an overview of what dates are already booked and get a quick overview of whether or not I’ll be able to fit your event into my schedule. I’ve also prepared some information for you as well as a press kit including a few variable-length bios and photographs to use on your event Web site. I prefer not to be booked more than 9 months in advance. -->

					<strong>Please note:</strong> While I read all of the emails I get, I sometimes don’t have the capacity to respond to every inquiry. As such, I only reply to emails that align with my goals and acknowledge my time and capabilities.
				</p>
				<p>
					As you may have concluded from the time frames mentioned in the previous sections above, <strong>I usually prioritize and reply to front-end development client inquiries first, then speaking and workshops inquiries, and then the rest of inquiries.</strong>
