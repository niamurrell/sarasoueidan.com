                            Today is one of those days that started out with a Google search for yet another accessibility question/concern. I’m working on a new project for my client Provata and part of that project is to build a sweet and seemingly simple help tooltip which explains to the reader/user what the Framingham calculator is. The tooltip is triggered by a small help icon like the one shown in the top right corner of this screenshot:

                            Staying productive during traveling can sometimes be a challenge. There are some things you can do to make the most out of your transit times and get more work done. Knomo—a UK based company that makes bags for digital nomads and techies like us, asked me to share some tips for staying productive while traveling. I shared four of the most important ones. I hope you find them useful! I will be sharing many more in another blog post too, so stay tuned!

                            Positioning elements inside an SVG image is very similar—if not identical—to positioning elements absolutely in HTML. Every element in SVG is positioned "absolutely" relative to the SVG viewport, and the position inside the viewport is governed by the current coordinate system in use. But this similarity in positioning elements should not conceal the fact that there is a fundamental difference between SVG elements and HTML elements: SVG elements do not have a box model like HTML elements do in CSS.

                            If you’re reading this article, then I can probably assume you’ve already decided to switch from using fonts for icons to an SVG icon system. Or maybe you're pondering the idea and want to get an overview of how that would be done and whether or not it's worth it. Either way, this post is here to help you with that. If you&rsquo;re not already convinced as to why SVG is a better icon system, then I highly recommend reading this article—a cagematch-style comparison between icon fonts and inline SVG for icon systems.

                            There are too few things not to like about SVG, and I don’t mean the things that browsers cause by incomplete or lack of certain features or buggy implementations. Yet you might sometimes get some unpredictable results that might frustrate you when working with SVG, if you don’t know the details of how certain features should behave and what to expect from them, as per the specifications. SVG presentation attributes come with a bit of their own behavior which might sometimes surprise you.

                            Happy new year! 🌟
OK, I felt awkward starting a blog post that way—I confess. ☺️ But this is also an unusual post—not an article about CSS or SVG, and not a lengthy tutorial about web development. It is also the quickest post I ever wrote.
This is my first time writing a year in review kind of post. A lot of great stuff has happened in 2015 that I thought are worth documenting and have a look back at a few years from now.

                            SVG can do much more than display static images. Its animation capabilities are one of its most powerful features, giving it a distinctive advantage over all other image formats. They are one of many reasons that make SVG images better than raster images, including GIFs. But this, of course, only applies to images that are good candidates for SVG, such as:
 Logos, non-complex, vector-based illustrations, user interface controls,  infographics, and icons.

                            Working with SVG in a RWD workflow usually involves a design phase and a development phase. The design phase is usually handled by designers who may or may not know how to code. And because of the nature of SVG as both an image format and a document format, every step taken in the graphics editor in the process of creating the SVG directly affects the resulting code and hence the work of the developer in charge of embedding, scripting or animating the SVG.

                            The CSS clip-path property is one of the most underused and yet most interesting properties in CSS. It can be used in conjunction with CSS Shapes to create interesting layouts, and can be taken to the extreme to create some incredibly impressive layouts and animations like the Species in Pieces project. While exploring the creation of arbitrarily-shaped UI components using CSS and SVG, it occurred to me that the clip-path property, when combined with SVG paths, can be used to create circular menus fairly easily, especially considering the (expected) browser behaviour when handling pointer events on clipped regions as per the specification.

                            This post is the first in a series of posts exploring techniques and examples that can be achieved using both CSS and SVG, and compares them both. Since I am biased to SVG, this series is really intended to prove that SVG — because of its nature as both an image and a document format — is simply better than CSS when it comes to solving certain design problems on the web.

                            I have recently finished a front-end development project for Provata Health — a US-based health and wellness company specializing in health promotion and behavior change science. As part of their marketing website, I worked on an infographic that showcases the three major health results one can achieve by following their health program. The graphic is a perfect candidate for SVG and you’ll see why throughout this article. But even though almost all of the graphics on the site were vector (which made the entire project exciting to me), I want to focus on this particular graphic and how and why I made the development choices I made while embedding it.

                            The state of SVG animation is changing. CSS, SMIL and JavaScript can be used to animate SVGs. However, SMIL is soon to be deprecated and was never supported in Internet Explorer. CSS animations on SVG elements don’t have the best browser support (yet), not to mention are quite buggy in some browsers. JavaScript is currently the best SVG animation tool. In this article, we'll go over the current and future state of SVG animation, giving you an overview of what you can and can't do, and some advice on what to choose for your specific animation needs.

                            The SVG viewBox attribute is easily one of SVG's most powerful features. Mastering this attribute can take your SVG skills to the next level, especially considering that a couple of the main SVG spriting techniques rely on this attribute to work. Because the viewBox attribute can be used to crop and extend the SVG canvas, it can be used for art-directing SVGs—by using it to crop the SVG to the area that you want to display at a time.

                            Besides using an SVG as a background image in CSS, you can serve SVG foreground images in HTML using one of several embedding techniques, each of which has its advantages and use cases. Unless you’re in need of interactivity or external styling, &lt;img&gt; is the standard way for loading an SVG image, but it has one disadvantage: you currently need JavaScript to provide fallback and/or change the image source for art direction.

                            If you&rsquo;re a designer, then you&rsquo;ve probably already come across blending effects some time or the other. Blending is one of the most frequently used effects in graphic and print design. You can add texture to text by blending it with its textured backdrop, create an illusion of merged images by blending these images together, and create a wide range of colorful effects that would not be possible without that fine level of color blending control.

                            One of the steps you need to do when working with SVG is optimizing the SVG code after exporting it from the editor and before embedding in on your web page. For that, several standalone optimization tools exits. The two tools I usually mention in my articles and talks are Peter Collingridge's online editor, and SVGO. In this article, I'm going to introduce you to a new SVGO Tool that provides us with everything Peter's tool does, and a bit more.

                            CSS can be used to style and animate scalable vector graphics, much like it is used to style and animate HTML elements. In this article I wrote for Smashing Magazine, which is a modified transcript of a talk I recently gave at CSSconf EU and From the Front, I’ll go over the prerequisites and techniques for working with CSS in SVG.

                            At any point in an SVG drawing, you can establish new viewports and user coordinate systems by either nesting &lt;svg&gt;s or using elements such as the &lt;symbol&gt; element, among others. In this article we're going to have a look at how we can do that and how this can be useful for controlling SVG elements and making them more flexible (and/or fluid). This is the third and last article in a series of articles about SVG coordinate systems and transformations.

                            SVG elements can be transformed by scaling, translating, skewing, and rotating&mdash;much like HTML elements can be transformed using CSS Transforms. However, there are certain inevitable differences when it comes to the coordinate systems used and affected by these transformations. In this article we'll go over the SVG transform attribute and CSS property, covering how to use it, and things you should know about SVG coordinate system transformations. This is the second article in a series I&rsquo;m writing about SVG coordinate systems and transformations.

                            SVG elements aren't governed by a CSS box model like HTML elements are. This makes positioning and transforming these elements trickier and may seem&mdash;at first glance&mdash;less intuitive. However, once you understand how SVG coordinate systems and transformations work, manipulating SVGs becomes a lot easier and makes a lot more sense. In this article we're going to go over three of the most important SVG attributes that control SVG coordinate systems: viewport, viewBox, and preserveAspectRatio.

                            CSS and SVG have a lot in common. A lot of the features that we have in CSS today were imported from SVG. One of these features is the Clipping operation. Both CSS and SVG allow us to "clip" elements into custom non-rectangular shapes. In this article we will go over the clipping techniques in both CSS and SVG, covering everything you need to know to get started.

                            SVG comes with its own ways for structuring a document by means of certain SVG elements that allow us to define, group, and reference objects within the document. These elements make reusing elements easy, while maintaining clean and readable code. In this article we'll go over these elements, highlighting the difference between them and the advantages of each one.

                            Using CSS shapes we can flow our content in non-rectangular areas. And sometimes we want to be able to flow our content into multiple custom-shaped areas inside an element. If you've read my previous article, you already know that this can be done with CSS Shapes, by using an image with alpha transparency with multiple shapes defined in it, and letting the browser extract the content's float areas from it. As appealing as this may sound and as creative as we can get with our shapes, flowing the text into multiple areas can easily make our content almost completely unreadable.

We used those images as a replacement for text on our pages, which made that text unaccessible and un-selectable.. But with all the advances in web design today, we can now create textured text effects using CSS, using SVG, and using HTML5 Canvas.

                            Today we can create all kinds of shapes with CSS using CSS transforms, but all these shapes do not affect the flow of the content inside or around them. That is, if you create a triangle or a trapezoid with CSS, for example, the shape created does not define or affect the way the text inside it flows, or the way inline text around it does.
With the introduction of CSS Shapes into the web, wrapping content in custom non-rectangular shapes, and recreating print designs and layouts on the web becomes a piece of cake!

                            The following is a collaboration post between Bennett Feely and I. After seeing Bennett's impressive animated navigation icon transformations (or "Navicon Transformicons") pens on Codepen, I asked him if he would like to write a tutorial on how he did them as a guest post on my blog. He kindly approved. And as he doesn't have a lot of free time to work the article, we decided to collaborate on it.

                            Today I'd like to share with you an interactive and touch-optimized metro app showcase concept for showcasing a metro (probably a Windows Phone) app screenshot. The screenshot will be draggable and swipable, and you'll have a couple of extra options to view how the app would look like in a mobile phone frame.
Please note that this demo works only in browsers that support the Javascript objects and APIs used. I provided a couple of polyfills but the demo will only work in browsers that these polyfills provide fallback for.

                            In this article, we will learn how to apply CSS transforms to fake a "slice" shape, creating a circular navigation using nothing but CSS (and some maths!). The article includes an interactive demo that explains visually and step by step how the technique works and the shapes are created.

                            Today I'm going to share with you a gallery plugin I built (yeah, like the world needs another gallery plugin, right?) after having stumbled upon SONY's products gallery while I was browsing their website a while ago. Their products' image gallery is a simple one, but two things grabbed my attention about the gallery: It's made with Flash when it can totally be created with HTML, CSS3 and Javascript. It has a neat feature: exiting the slideshow mode back to the grid view mode, the last image which was active in the slideshow mode "

                            It's not enough to bring animations and visual transitions to an interface, they should serve a purpose and goal, and this goal should be improving the user's experience.  Transitions [&hellip;] provide the grease that smoothes out what happens in the interface. Without transitional effects the user can be left to wonder what just occurred.
 In today&rsquo;s tutorial, we&rsquo;ll be creating some creative animations and transitions for adding and removing items from a list, inspired by the concept from Pasquale D&rsquo;Silva&rsquo;s article on Medium.

                            In this tutorial today we're going to create a horizontal portfolio layout with cool hover effects inspired by those on Guillaume Tomasi's personal website. The website is made in Flash, so I thought it would be nice to recreate the flash hover effect of the portfolio items using CSS3 animations and transitions, and some jQuery to replicate the image pan effect on hover.
I've also added a simple falling down effect on scroll, where the portfolio items fall down as soon as they enter the visible area of the viewport.

I believe that you should read this book yourselves to fully appreciate all the information and insight the writer has to share. I will cover only the first half of the book. I will be pasting some excerpts, because there are many things that the writer describes a lot better than I could ever do.

                            I have recently realized that CSS3 3D transforms have been out there for quite a long time now and yet I haven't experimented with them yet. I have also been using Windows 8 for a while now, and the first thing that struck me as impressive about it was the transitions and animations built into the dashboard, so I thought it would be really cool if my first experiment with CSS 3D transforms would be to recreate those animations and effects.
