After seeing Bennett&#39;s impressive animated navigation icon transformations (or &#34;Navicon Transformicons&#34;) pens on Codepen, I asked him if he would like to write a tutorial on how he did them as a guest post on my blog. He kindly approved. And as he doesn&#39;t have a lot of free time to work the article, we decided to collaborate on it.</description>
