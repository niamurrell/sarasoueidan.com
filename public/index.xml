      <description>Today is one of those days that started out with a Google search for yet another accessibility question/concern. I‚Äôm working on a new project for my client Provata and part of that project is to build a sweet and seemingly simple help tooltip which explains to the reader/user what the Framingham calculator is. The tooltip is triggered by a small help icon like the one shown in the top right corner of this screenshot:</description>

      <title>Mimic Relative Positioning Inside an SVG with Nested SVGs</title>
      <link>https://sarasoueidan.com/blog/mimic-relative-positioning-in-svg/</link>

      <guid>https://sarasoueidan.com/blog/mimic-relative-positioning-in-svg/</guid>
      <description>Positioning elements inside an SVG image is very similar‚Äîif not identical‚Äîto positioning elements absolutely in HTML. Every element in SVG is positioned &#34;absolutely&#34; relative to the SVG viewport, and the position inside the viewport is governed by the current coordinate system in use. But this similarity in positioning elements should not conceal the fact that there is a fundamental difference between SVG elements and HTML elements: SVG elements do not have a box model like HTML elements do in CSS.</description>

      <title>Making the Switch Away from Icon Fonts to SVG: Converting Font Icons to SVG</title>

      <description>If you‚Äôre reading this article, then I can probably assume you‚Äôve already decided to switch from using fonts for icons to an SVG icon system. Or maybe you&#39;re pondering the idea and want to get an overview of how that would be done and whether or not it&#39;s worth it. Either way, this post is here to help you with that. If you&amp;rsquo;re not already convinced as to why SVG is a better icon system, then I highly recommend reading this article‚Äîa cagematch-style comparison between icon fonts and inline SVG for icon systems.</description>

      <description>There are too few things not to like about SVG, and I don‚Äôt mean the things that browsers cause by incomplete or lack of certain features or buggy implementations. Yet you might sometimes get some unpredictable results that might frustrate you when working with SVG, if you don‚Äôt know the details of how certain features should behave and what to expect from them, as per the specifications. SVG presentation attributes come with a bit of their own behavior which might sometimes surprise you.</description>

      <description>Happy new year! üåü
OK, I felt awkward starting a blog post that way‚ÄîI confess. ‚ò∫Ô∏è But this is also an unusual post‚Äînot an article about CSS or SVG, and not a lengthy tutorial about web development. It is also the quickest post I ever wrote.
This is my first time writing a year in review kind of post. A lot of great stuff has happened in 2015 that I thought are worth documenting and have a look back at a few years from now.</description>

      <title>Animated SVG vs GIF [CAGEMATCH]</title>
      <link>https://sarasoueidan.com/blog/svg-vs-gif/</link>

      <guid>https://sarasoueidan.com/blog/svg-vs-gif/</guid>
      <description>SVG can do much more than display static images. Its animation capabilities are one of its most powerful features, giving it a distinctive advantage over all other image formats. They are one of many reasons that make SVG images better than raster images, including GIFs. But this, of course, only applies to images that are good candidates for SVG, such as:
 Logos, non-complex, vector-based illustrations, user interface controls,  infographics, and icons.</description>

      <title>Tips for Creating and Exporting Better SVGs for the Web</title>
      <link>https://sarasoueidan.com/blog/svg-tips-for-designers/</link>

      <guid>https://sarasoueidan.com/blog/svg-tips-for-designers/</guid>
      <description>Working with SVG in a RWD workflow usually involves a design phase and a development phase. The design phase is usually handled by designers who may or may not know how to code. And because of the nature of SVG as both an image format and a document format, every step taken in the graphics editor in the process of creating the SVG directly affects the resulting code and hence the work of the developer in charge of embedding, scripting or animating the SVG.</description>

      <description>This is the last article in the series of article comparing common CSS techniques to their SVG counterparts. This article is a roundup of several CSS and SVG solutions, as opposed to being an article comparing one solution that can be achieved using either CSS and SVG. There are already a bunch of excellent articles out there that cover the details for each of these solutions, so we will get an overview of each solution and link to those articles for each section as we go.</description>

      <title>Building A Circular Navigation with CSS Clip Paths</title>
      <link>https://sarasoueidan.com/blog/building-a-circular-navigation-with-css-clip-paths/</link>

      <guid>https://sarasoueidan.com/blog/building-a-circular-navigation-with-css-clip-paths/</guid>
      <description>The CSS clip-path property is one of the most underused and yet most interesting properties in CSS. It can be used in conjunction with CSS Shapes to create interesting layouts, and can be taken to the extreme to create some incredibly impressive layouts and animations like the Species in Pieces project. While exploring the creation of arbitrarily-shaped UI components using CSS and SVG, it occurred to me that the clip-path property, when combined with SVG paths, can be used to create circular menus fairly easily, especially considering the (expected) browser behaviour when handling pointer events on clipped regions as per the specification.</description>

      <description>This post is the first in a series of posts exploring techniques and examples that can be achieved using both CSS and SVG, and compares them both. Since I am biased to SVG, this series is really intended to prove that SVG ‚Äî because of its nature as both an image and a document format ‚Äî is simply better than CSS when it comes to solving certain design problems on the web.</description>

      <description>An in-depth article on how to style the contents of the SVG &amp;lt;use&amp;gt; element and overcome some challenges it brings. We get into where the contents are cloned (the shadow DOM!), what limitations that brings up and how to work around them by taking advantage of the CSS cascade and using CSS Variables to get full control over the content while providing fallback for non-supporting browsers. </description>

      <description>I have recently finished a front-end development project for Provata Health ‚Äî a US-based health and wellness company specializing in health promotion and behavior change science. As part of their marketing website, I worked on an infographic that showcases the three major health results one can achieve by following their health program. The graphic is a perfect candidate for SVG and you‚Äôll see why throughout this article. But even though almost all of the graphics on the site were vector (which made the entire project exciting to me), I want to focus on this particular graphic and how and why I made the development choices I made while embedding it.</description>

      <guid>https://sarasoueidan.com/blog/state-of-svg-animation/</guid>
      <description>The state of SVG animation is changing. CSS, SMIL and JavaScript can be used to animate SVGs. However, SMIL is soon to be deprecated and was never supported in Internet Explorer. CSS animations on SVG elements don‚Äôt have the best browser support (yet), not to mention are quite buggy in some browsers. JavaScript is currently the best SVG animation tool. In this article, we&#39;ll go over the current and future state of SVG animation, giving you an overview of what you can and can&#39;t do, and some advice on what to choose for your specific animation needs.</description>

      <description>The SVG viewBox attribute is easily one of SVG&#39;s most powerful features. Mastering this attribute can take your SVG skills to the next level, especially considering that a couple of the main SVG spriting techniques rely on this attribute to work. Because the viewBox attribute can be used to crop and extend the SVG canvas, it can be used for art-directing SVGs‚Äîby using it to crop the SVG to the area that you want to display at a time.</description>

In this article, we will learn all about that, and more. </description>

      <description>Besides using an SVG as a background image in CSS, you can serve SVG foreground images in HTML using one of several embedding techniques, each of which has its advantages and use cases. Unless you‚Äôre in need of interactivity or external styling, &amp;lt;img&amp;gt; is the standard way for loading an SVG image, but it has one disadvantage: you currently need JavaScript to provide fallback and/or change the image source for art direction.</description>

      <description>If you&amp;rsquo;re a designer, then you&amp;rsquo;ve probably already come across blending effects some time or the other. Blending is one of the most frequently used effects in graphic and print design. You can add texture to text by blending it with its textured backdrop, create an illusion of merged images by blending these images together, and create a wide range of colorful effects that would not be possible without that fine level of color blending control.</description>

      <description>One of the steps you need to do when working with SVG is optimizing the SVG code after exporting it from the editor and before embedding in on your web page. For that, several standalone optimization tools exits. The two tools I usually mention in my articles and talks are Peter Collingridge&#39;s online editor, and SVGO. In this article, I&#39;m going to introduce you to a new SVGO Tool that provides us with everything Peter&#39;s tool does, and a bit more.</description>

      <description>You may or may not have used the :target selector before; and you may or may not have used it to show and hide elements without having to resort to JavaScript to handle this event for you. This article I wrote for the Adobe Dreamweaver team blog, serves as a short introduction to the :target selector, showing how you can use it to create JavaScript-less UI effects‚Äîfor example, overlays, modals, etc.</description>

      <guid>https://sarasoueidan.com/blog/nesting-svgs/</guid>
      <description>At any point in an SVG drawing, you can establish new viewports and user coordinate systems by either nesting &amp;lt;svg&amp;gt;s or using elements such as the &amp;lt;symbol&amp;gt; element, among others. In this article we&#39;re going to have a look at how we can do that and how this can be useful for controlling SVG elements and making them more flexible (and/or fluid). This is the third and last article in a series of articles about SVG coordinate systems and transformations.</description>

      <description>SVG elements can be transformed by scaling, translating, skewing, and rotating&amp;mdash;much like HTML elements can be transformed using CSS Transforms. However, there are certain inevitable differences when it comes to the coordinate systems used and affected by these transformations. In this article we&#39;ll go over the SVG transform attribute and CSS property, covering how to use it, and things you should know about SVG coordinate system transformations. This is the second article in a series I&amp;rsquo;m writing about SVG coordinate systems and transformations.</description>

      <description>SVG elements aren&#39;t governed by a CSS box model like HTML elements are. This makes positioning and transforming these elements trickier and may seem&amp;mdash;at first glance&amp;mdash;less intuitive. However, once you understand how SVG coordinate systems and transformations work, manipulating SVGs becomes a lot easier and makes a lot more sense. In this article we&#39;re going to go over three of the most important SVG attributes that control SVG coordinate systems: viewport, viewBox, and preserveAspectRatio.</description>

      <description>CSS and SVG have a lot in common. A lot of the features that we have in CSS today were imported from SVG. One of these features is the Clipping operation. Both CSS and SVG allow us to &#34;clip&#34; elements into custom non-rectangular shapes. In this article we will go over the clipping techniques in both CSS and SVG, covering everything you need to know to get started.

      <guid>https://sarasoueidan.com/blog/structuring-grouping-referencing-in-svg/</guid>
      <description>SVG comes with its own ways for structuring a document by means of certain SVG elements that allow us to define, group, and reference objects within the document. These elements make reusing elements easy, while maintaining clean and readable code. In this article we&#39;ll go over these elements, highlighting the difference between them and the advantages of each one.
Grouping with the &amp;lt;g&amp;gt; element The &amp;lsquo;g&amp;rsquo; in &amp;lt;g&amp;gt; stands for &amp;lsquo;group&amp;rsquo;.</description>

So, even though the content of the article may go in vain, I think it&amp;rsquo;s still worth sharing why I think CSS Regions mattered, and wish they weren&amp;rsquo;t ditched like that. I hope you guys like it anyway.

      <guid>https://sarasoueidan.com/blog/css-regions-with-shapes-for-readability/</guid>
      <description>Using CSS shapes we can flow our content in non-rectangular areas. And sometimes we want to be able to flow our content into multiple custom-shaped areas inside an element. If you&#39;ve read my previous article, you already know that this can be done with CSS Shapes, by using an image with alpha transparency with multiple shapes defined in it, and letting the browser extract the content&#39;s float areas from it. As appealing as this may sound and as creative as we can get with our shapes, flowing the text into multiple areas can easily make our content almost completely unreadable.</description>

      <description>For too long, we&#39;ve resorted to graphics editors to create images of text that has nice effects such as creative fills or that blends with its background in a nice subtle way. We used those images as a replacement for text on our pages, which made that text unaccessible and un-selectable.. But with all the advances in web design today, we can now create textured text effects using CSS, using SVG, and using HTML5 Canvas.</description>

There are different approaches to creating overlays, some of them work better than others, and some of them come with gotchas that you need to be aware of, including performance implications. In HTML5, we also get a native way to create modals with less hassle and less code. In this article, we will cover all of that. </description>

      <guid>https://sarasoueidan.com/blog/css-shapes/</guid>
      <description>Today we can create all kinds of shapes with CSS using CSS transforms, but all these shapes do not affect the flow of the content inside or around them. That is, if you create a triangle or a trapezoid with CSS, for example, the shape created does not define or affect the way the text inside it flows, or the way inline text around it does.
With the introduction of CSS Shapes into the web, wrapping content in custom non-rectangular shapes, and recreating print designs and layouts on the web becomes a piece of cake!</description>

Their products&#39; image gallery is a simple one, but two things grabbed my attention about the gallery: It&#39;s made with Flash when it can totally be created with HTML, CSS3 and Javascript. It has a neat feature: exiting the slideshow mode back to the grid view mode, the last image which was active in the slideshow mode &#34;</description>

      <description>It&#39;s not enough to bring animations and visual transitions to an interface, they should serve a purpose and goal, and this goal should be improving the user&#39;s experience.  Transitions [&amp;hellip;] provide the grease that smoothes out what happens in the interface. Without transitional effects the user can be left to wonder what just occurred.
 In today&amp;rsquo;s tutorial, we&amp;rsquo;ll be creating some creative animations and transitions for adding and removing items from a list, inspired by the concept from Pasquale D&amp;rsquo;Silva&amp;rsquo;s article on Medium.</description>

      <description>In this tutorial today we&#39;re going to create a horizontal portfolio layout with cool hover effects inspired by those on Guillaume Tomasi&#39;s personal website. The website is made in Flash, so I thought it would be nice to recreate the flash hover effect of the portfolio items using CSS3 animations and transitions, and some jQuery to replicate the image pan effect on hover.
I&#39;ve also added a simple falling down effect on scroll, where the portfolio items fall down as soon as they enter the visible area of the viewport.</description>

      <description>I have recently realized that CSS3 3D transforms have been out there for quite a long time now and yet I haven&#39;t experimented with them yet. I have also been using Windows 8 for a while now, and the first thing that struck me as impressive about it was the transitions and animations built into the dashboard, so I thought it would be really cool if my first experiment with CSS 3D transforms would be to recreate those animations and effects.</description>

      <description>The Provata Health Web site homepage.         Background   In March 2015, Alex Goldberg, Provata Health CEO, got in touch with me regarding building a marketing Web site for his startup. At that time, Alex was already determined to hire me for this job because he saw me as a perfect fit for it. (&amp;lt;3)  We jumped on a Skype call for the first time a few weeks after his initial e-mail because I had been touring the world at that time, giving talks at conferences.</description>

      <description>Please note: the screenshots shown in this case study are screenshots of the UI I built and finished early December 2016. The UI or some of its component styles [may] have changed since then, as the Smashing team [may] have made some changes to it after my work with them was finished.  Please also note that the content in the screenshots is not the real content of the magazine. I was working with static pages and most of the content I used was placeholder content and images, so that is what is shown in the screenshots as well.</description>
