<p class="size-2x">
	An in-depth article on how to style the contents of the SVG &lt;use&gt; element and overcome some challenges it brings. We get into where the contents are cloned (the shadow DOM!), what limitations that brings up and how to work around them by taking advantage of the CSS cascade and using CSS Variables to get full control over the content while providing fallback for non-supporting browsers.
