<p class="size-2x">
	This is the last article in the series of article comparing common CSS techniques to their SVG counterparts. This article is a roundup of several CSS and SVG solutions, as opposed to being an article comparing one solution that can be achieved using either CSS and SVG. There are already a bunch of excellent articles out there that cover the details for each of these solutions, so we will get an overview of each solution and link to those articles for each section as we go. I highly recommend you check them all out.
