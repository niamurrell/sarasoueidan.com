Today, O'Reilly's Fluent Conf is taking place in San Francisco, California. And as part of the conference, the O'Reilly Web Platform Awards were announced. Apparently, I was nominated for an award and, according to the co-chairs of the conference, I got the most amount of nominations and eventually won an award.

<blockquote>
	O’Reilly Web Platform Awards recognize individual contributors who have demonstrated exceptional leadership, creativity, and collaboration in the development of JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and the supporting Web ecosystem. The nomination process is open to the entire web community and all entries will be judged by the Fluent program committee.

This is my first time ever winning a web award, and I feel privileged to have won it from such a prestigious company.

Simon sent me the "Congratulations, you won a web platform award!" email a couple of weeks before the awards were announced. My first reaction when I read the email was: “Okay this must have gotten into my inbox by mistake.” So I ended up responding to his message asking him if the email was really intended for _me_. He said that it was. I couldn't believe it for a while and it took me some time to let the idea sink in that I had actually won an award.

I had _no clue_.

I love doing what I do and sharing what I know. I find great pleasure in helping others with what I know and always have—ever since I can remember. I really don't know what to say except __Thank You__ to each and every one who nominated me, and to the committee who voted, and to O'Reilly Fluent for this great award. It is such a wonderful and overwhelming feeling to realize that your work has been recognized by the very community you're part of and have been contributing to. To know that the community appreciates your work and finds it useful is one of the best feelings ever.

__Thank you__.
