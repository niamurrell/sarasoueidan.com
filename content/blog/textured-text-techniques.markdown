<p class="size-2x">
	For too long, we've resorted to graphics editors to create <em>images</em> of text that has nice effects such as creative fills or that blends with its background in a nice subtle way. We used those images as a replacement for text on our pages, which made that text unaccessible and un-selectable.. But with all the advances in web design today, we can now create textured text effects using CSS, using SVG, and using HTML5 Canvas. This article introduces and shows you how to do that using all of those techniques.
