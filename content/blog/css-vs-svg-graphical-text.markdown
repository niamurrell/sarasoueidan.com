	This post is the first in a series of posts exploring techniques and examples that can be achieved using both CSS and SVG, and compares them both. Since I am biased to SVG, this series is really intended to prove that SVG — because of its nature as both an image and a document format — is simply better than CSS when it comes to solving certain design problems on the web. But to keep an objective point of view, we will be weighing the pros and cons of each technique and find out where and when CSS or SVG can serve as a better tool to the design goals at hand.
	In this article, we’re going to look into the CSS <code>background-clip</code> and <code>mask-image</code> properties, as well as SVG pattern fills and masks.
