                            Today is one of those days that started out with a Google search for yet another accessibility question/concern. I’m working on a new project for my client Provata and part of that project is to build a sweet and seemingly simple help tooltip which explains to the reader/user what the Framingham calculator is. The tooltip is triggered by a small help icon like the one shown in the top right corner of this screenshot:

                            Staying productive during traveling can sometimes be a challenge. There are some things you can do to make the most out of your transit times and get more work done. Knomo—a UK based company that makes bags for digital nomads and techies like us, asked me to share some tips for staying productive while traveling. I shared four of the most important ones. I hope you find them useful! I will be sharing many more in another blog post too, so stay tuned!

                            Positioning elements inside an SVG image is very similar—if not identical—to positioning elements absolutely in HTML. Every element in SVG is positioned "absolutely" relative to the SVG viewport, and the position inside the viewport is governed by the current coordinate system in use. But this similarity in positioning elements should not conceal the fact that there is a fundamental difference between SVG elements and HTML elements: SVG elements do not have a box model like HTML elements do in CSS.

                            If you’re reading this article, then I can probably assume you’ve already decided to switch from using fonts for icons to an SVG icon system. Or maybe you're pondering the idea and want to get an overview of how that would be done and whether or not it's worth it. Either way, this post is here to help you with that. If you&rsquo;re not already convinced as to why SVG is a better icon system, then I highly recommend reading this article—a cagematch-style comparison between icon fonts and inline SVG for icon systems.

                            There are too few things not to like about SVG, and I don’t mean the things that browsers cause by incomplete or lack of certain features or buggy implementations. Yet you might sometimes get some unpredictable results that might frustrate you when working with SVG, if you don’t know the details of how certain features should behave and what to expect from them, as per the specifications. SVG presentation attributes come with a bit of their own behavior which might sometimes surprise you.

                            Happy new year! 🌟
OK, I felt awkward starting a blog post that way—I confess. ☺️ But this is also an unusual post—not an article about CSS or SVG, and not a lengthy tutorial about web development. It is also the quickest post I ever wrote.
This is my first time writing a year in review kind of post. A lot of great stuff has happened in 2015 that I thought are worth documenting and have a look back at a few years from now.

                            SVG can do much more than display static images. Its animation capabilities are one of its most powerful features, giving it a distinctive advantage over all other image formats. They are one of many reasons that make SVG images better than raster images, including GIFs. But this, of course, only applies to images that are good candidates for SVG, such as:
 Logos, non-complex, vector-based illustrations, user interface controls,  infographics, and icons.

                            Working with SVG in a RWD workflow usually involves a design phase and a development phase. The design phase is usually handled by designers who may or may not know how to code. And because of the nature of SVG as both an image format and a document format, every step taken in the graphics editor in the process of creating the SVG directly affects the resulting code and hence the work of the developer in charge of embedding, scripting or animating the SVG.

There are already a bunch of excellent articles out there that cover the details for each of these solutions, so we will get an overview of each solution and link to those articles for each section as we go.
