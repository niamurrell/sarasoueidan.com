                    Want to level up your or your team’s front-end development skills, but are overwhelmed by the sheer amount of resources on different topics and don’t have enough time to read the never-ending amount of articles &amp; books available? Want to get up and running fast, learning the most recent and relevant skills to get the job done? I can help.

                    I am currently running front-end development workshops focusing on CSS and SVG. If your company, team, or event could benefit from a full or half-day workshop on one of these topics, I’d love to help provide you with one (or even two!).
